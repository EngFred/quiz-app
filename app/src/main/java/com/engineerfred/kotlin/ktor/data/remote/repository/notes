Your approach seems reasonable at first glance, but there's a crucial aspect of asynchronous programming that needs to be considered. When you call PhoneAuthProvider.verifyPhoneNumber(options), it initiates an asynchronous operation to verify the phone number. The callbacks (onVerificationFailed, onVerificationCompleted, etc.) are invoked sometime later when the verification process completes or encounters an error.

In your code, you're returning response immediately after initiating the verification process. However, at this point, the callbacks may not have been invoked yet, so response might not have been assigned a value. This can lead to returning Response.Undefined or an incorrect response.

To ensure that you return the correct response after the verification process completes or fails, you typically need to wait for the asynchronous operation to finish. This is why using a Channel or some other form of synchronization mechanism, as demonstrated in the previous examples, is a common approach in Kotlin for handling asynchronous operations with coroutines.

If you're looking for a simpler solution without using channels or other synchronization mechanisms, you might consider using callbacks or listeners directly in your function, but keep in mind that this can make the code more complex and harder to manage, especially in larger codebases.
